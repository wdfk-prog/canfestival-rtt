Before doing a final 'setup.py makedist':

1. Run:
     $ python disthelper/scripts/indentcheck.py .

   If any files are reported as having mixed tabs/spaces,
   fix them (rerun indentcheck.py with -v for details).

2. Run:
     $ python disthelper/scripts/test/mega_tabber_test.py
 
   After it finishes, make sure that ttt/diff.disthelper
   and ttt/diff.gnosis are zero bytes. (It will tell you.)

   If not, look in the diffs - there are probably some
   files that have inconsistent space-indents (i.e. 2/3/4
   spaces, in the same file). The first occurrance will
   throw off the rest of the file, so you usually only
   have to change one or two places.

   Keep running until the diffs are zero bytes.
   You have to do a `rm -rf ttt` between runs.

   When all is good, 'rm -rf ttt'

   [Note that mega_tabber_test.py does NOT change
    any source files. That's the point - to run
    the test on a copy, and fix problems by hand.]

3. Ensure that gnosis/version.py is bumped.

4. python setup.py makedist
