Gnosis Utilities contains several subpackages for working with XML,
as well as other generally useful tools. The major modules are:

     gnosis.indexer          (Full-text indexing/searching)
     gnosis.xml.pickle       (XML pickling of Python objects)
     gnosis.xml.objectify    (Any XML to "native" Python objects)
     gnosis.xml.validity     (Enforce validity constraints)
     gnosis.xml.relax        (Tools for working with RelaxNG)
     gnosis.xml.indexer      (XPATH indexing of XML documents)
     [...].convert.txt2html  (Convert ASCII source files to HTML)
     gnosis.util.dtd2sql     (DTD -> SQL 'CREATE TABLE' statements)
     gnosis.util.sql2dtd     (SQL query -> DTD for query results)
     gnosis.util.xml2sql     (XML -> SQL 'INSERT INTO' statements)
     gnosis.util.combinators (Combinatorial higher-order functions)
     gnosis.util.introspect  (Introspect Python objects)
     gnosis.magic            (Multimethods, metaclasses, etc)

Installation (*):

   python setup.py install

   | Shortcut: (**)
   |   If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you can
   |   install for all of them at one time by using:
   |
   |     python setup.py install_all

Trying it out:

   cd gnosis/xml/pickle/test
   python test_all.py

(or similarly for other subpackages)

If any errors occur, please email mertz@gnosis.cx, or frankm@hiwaay.net.
Please include the output from test_all.py in your email, as well
as other pertinent details such as Python version and operating system.

For more info, e.g.:

   pydoc gnosis
   pydoc gnosis.xml.pickle.doc
   See xml_matters articles under gnosis/doc

(*) If you are using Python 2.0, you must first install
a newer version of PyXML.

   See:
      http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/download.html

   NOTE: If you are using Python 1.5 or 1.6, you must install version
   0.7.x of PyXML; versions 0.8 and up dropped support for 1.5 and 1.6.
   There are currently issues with running portions of Gnosis with
   Python < 2.0. Patches are accepted, if minimally intrusive.

 You don't have to do anything for Python 2.1 and up.

(**) If "install_all" fails to detect all versions of Python
that you have installed, please email frankm@hiwaay.net with
details of your setup.
