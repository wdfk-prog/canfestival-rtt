'disthelper' is a collection of scripts and modules that
are generally useful for building/maintaining a setup.py.

To use it in your own distribution, simply copy the entire
'disthelper' tree into the toplevel of your tree, as has
been done here.

Useful things:

    find_python.py:
        Enumerate available Python installations on
        the current machine.

    treeops:
        Modules that make it easy to write tree-crawling
        utilities.

    # The following are all tree-crawling utilities that
    # take the same set of options (-r, -R, -x ...).
    # Use -h for help on each.
    
    scripts/indentcheck.py:
        Checks consistency of tab/space usage for
        an entire tree of files. Use -v to show
        lines where errors occurred.

    scripts/comptree.py:
        Byte-compile an entire tree of files.

    scripts/difftree.py:
        Portable replacement for 'diff -r', on
        two directories.
       
    scripts/porttext.py:
        Convert a tree of files to "portable" text
        format (\n).

    scripts/plattext.py:
        Convert a tree of files to platform-specific
        text format (\n,\r\n, whatever the machine
        running the script uses.)

    scripts/rmfind.py
        Portable replacement for simple uses of
        "rm `find ..`". e.g. instead of:
              rm `find . -name "*.pyc"`

        Use:
              rmfind.py -r -x pyc .
        Or:
              rmfind.py -R "*.pyc" .

     *
     * Please use some caution when using the next two
     * scripts. Running an untab/tab or tab/untab cycle
     * may result in blocks of code being shifted left/right,
     * since it will normalize the code to a fixed indent
     * width (user-specified; defaults to 4).
     *
     * Although the resulting code should still run identically,
     * there is a chance it will be wrong.
     * 
     * Please backup your source files before running these.
     *

     scripts/untabtree.py
        Convert tabs to spaces for a tree of files.

            | Will refuse to touch a file if indentcheck
            | fails on it.

     scripts/tabtree.py
        Convert spaces to tabs for a tree of files.

            | Will refuse to touch a file if indentcheck
            | fails on it.
